How CLI Works
    -> "Read Eval Print Loop (REPL)":
        = read: type in a command ("ls", "cd", "etc") and then press enter
        = eval (written in C): cli software (shell, bash, powershell) takes in the program. parses arguments, or flags. 
        = print: sends a response back to the shell
